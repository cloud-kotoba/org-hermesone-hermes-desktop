;; Shard host: one heap for every profile's cron schedule.
;;
;; Upstream's multiplexed gateway visits EVERY served profile every 60 s:
;; liveness probe, cron lock, jobs.json read, sweeps and a heartbeat write,
;; whether or not anything is due (measured 2026-10-09: 1,012 profiles, ~205%
;; CPU and 722 threads with zero agents running). The shard host keeps one
;; min-heap keyed by each profile's earliest `next_run_at` and calls upstream's
;; own `tick()`, in that profile's scope, only when the profile is due. Job
;; execution, delivery, misfire grace and fire claims all stay upstream's.
;;
;; Modes:
;;   observe  index and schedule, record what WOULD fire, execute nothing.
;;            Safe next to a live upstream multiplexer (it keeps ticking).
;;   run      tick due profiles. Refuses to start while an upstream
;;            multiplexer is live, so no job can run twice.
