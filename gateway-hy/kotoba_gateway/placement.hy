;; Placement without a central store: which node runs which Hermes profile.
;;
;; The owner (2026-10-09) ruled out D1, R2 and KV for this. Placement is an
;; operator-signed manifest instead:
;;
;;   {"type" "kotoba.placement" "version" n "issued_at" t
;;    "nodes"    [{"did" "url" "residency" [...] "caps" [...] "weight" w} ...]
;;    "profiles" [{"id" "residency" "pin" "caps" "cost"} ...]
;;    "signer" operator-did "signature" ...}
;;
;; Every node holds a copy and adopts another only when it is signed by the
;; trusted operator did and carries a higher version. Copies travel over the
;; Kotoba mesh: nodes pull `GET /v1/placement` from the nodes the manifest
;; lists. The manifest is also the trust list: its nodes may call each other.
;;
;; Ownership is computed, not stored:
;;   - a pinned profile belongs to its pinned node. Nothing else is consulted,
;;     so two nodes can never both run it (a down pin node means the profile
;;     waits);
;;   - an unpinned profile belongs to the highest weighted-rendezvous score
;;     among nodes this node sees alive. A node is alive while its signed
;;     node manifest (`issued_at`) is fresh within TTL, so a node takes over
;;     only after the previous owner has been silent for a full TTL.
;;
;; Unpinned failover is best effort under asymmetric partitions (two nodes
;; can briefly disagree on who is alive). Pins give exactly-one; phase 3's
;; canary uses pins only.
